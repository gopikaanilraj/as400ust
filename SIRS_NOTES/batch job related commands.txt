INTERACTIVELY

    Call pgm1   it interacts realtime with system , only when this command completes we can execute next one.



Batch job can be submitted by sbmjob cmd



Batch job cycle :
sbmJOB command 
   job enters JOBQ-->BASED ON JOB PRIORITY IT  ENTERS  SUBSYSTEM  AND GETS ACTIVE (KIND OF WORKSPACE of our job to run)--> outq(it generates spool files and all)

Job priorities in job queue:
------------------------------------

1 to 9 : 9 being lowest and 1 being highest

run priority in subsystem
--------------------------
it is the priority with which job can use subsystem resources.
Job is already running and 

Job queues and subsystem are attached.
wrksbsd subsystemname (to check details of subsystem)

dspsbsd subsytemname (to display subsystem)

wrkjobq jobqquename  ( to check and work on jobs in job queue)
 wrkjob jobaname(work with jobs)

changing job : 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If we need to change details of job(like job queue , job priority) we can directly use wrkjob and change job  
   or we can get into job queue , take option 2 and  change run priority of that job..

or we can use CHGJOB command.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

error handling
---------------------------

1. Checking actjob
     wrkactjob (It will show all active jobs in system) 
    wrkactjob sbs(Qbatch)   it will show only active jobs in qbatch subsystem.

 2. we can check job log and identify error.
       dspjoblog jobname
       


3. WE CAN CHECK MESSAGES from *SYSOPR MSGQUEUE
    DSPMSG  *sYSOPR
    Take option 5 for our jobs message and then reply

 or

    we can directly to go to active job list and take option 7 we will get reply options and we can take appropriate reply.



message reply options in CL 
c: Cancel
d : Cancel and dump  (This will cancel your process and creates a QPPGMDMP dump spool file)
i  : Ignore failing command
r   : Retry failing command 



Message reply options in RPGLE

c "cancel
g (getin) : pass control to first c spec of ur pgm
d : CANCEL AND CREATES  dump (QPPGMDMP SPOOL FILE)
f : CANCEL AND IT CREATES fully formatted dump SPOOL FILE.

                                                               


COMAMND RELATED TO BATCH JOBS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sbmjob :

command :

wrkusrjob  username :  Work with all jobs (both interactive and batch submitted by user)
wrkusrjob               if no user name parameter is provided it displays all jobs of current user.

wrksbmjob  username : this will give only submitted (batch) job details of current user or provided user


wrkjobq job queuename  (get all jobs in job queue)

wrkactjob
wrkactjob sbs(subsystem name)

hldjobq : hold jobq queue
hldjob : Hold job

   dspmsg  *sysopr (display all exception messages on SYSOPR message queue or system operator message queue)
   

COMMAND TO CHECK LOCKS ON AS400 objects :
wrkobjlck   we need to give object name and type

sample command to checks lock on file :
   WRKOBJLCK OBJ(EMPPF) OBJTYPE(*FILE)   

dsprcdlck : to get details of record lock in file.




--------------------------------Batch debug--------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO DEBUG BATCH JOB , job needs to be in stop state either in error(msgw) or we need to hold it.


1. start service job using STRSRVJOB command.
2. enter debug command  like adding breakpoints and all 
USING DSPMODSRC

3. mAKE job run either by releasing or answering error

4. ONCE It starts running it will stop at breakpoint and we can debug.

5. Once debug done  do end debug using ENDDBG command

6. END SERVICE JOB endsrvjob
